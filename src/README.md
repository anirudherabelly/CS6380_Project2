Extend the simulator you developed in Project 1 to simulate asynchronous networks. 
The message transmission time for each link for each message is to be randomly chosen using a uniform distribution in the range 1 to 10 “time units.” 
All links are bidirectional and FIFO. (FIFO: If I send two messages m1 and then m2 to you, then you receive m1 first and then m2.)
Implement the Asynchronous FloodMax algorithm for leader election. 
Compute the total number of messages sent for the run and output the result.
